		<h2>WARNING: this website is legit.</h2>
		<p>No need to download any file, simply keeping this window open will and allow you to have more RAM, for free.</p>
		<p>This website is bare bones, yet don't be fooled, it actually works! Tried it on my device.</p>
		<p>The RAM may take a few seconds to load, depending on your internet connection.</p>
